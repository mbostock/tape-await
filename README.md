# tape-await

A synchronous test without *test*.end:

```js
tape("42 is a number", test => {
  test.equal(typeof 42, "number");
});
```

A synchronous test that throws an error which is treated as a failure:

```js
tape("errors are failures", test => {
  throw new Error("fail");
});
```

An asynchronous test:

```js
tape("promises are great", async test => {
  await new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, 250));
  test.ok(true);
});
```

To use, require tape-await instead of tape:

```js
const tape = require("tape-await");
```

And in your package.json:

```json
  "devDependencies": {
    "tape": "4",
    "tape-await": "0.1"
  }
```

This module is similar to [tape-async](https://www.npmjs.org/package/tape-async), [tape-promise](https://www.npmjs.org/package/tape-promise), and [blue-tape](https://www.npmjs.org/package/blue-tape). One difference is that it *also* provides implicit *test*.end for synchronous tests, rather than only providing it for asynchronous tests. Another is that it correctly handles rejected promises with falsey values, such as `Promise.reject()`. Also, it only supports promises and not generators, and does not attempt to deal with unhandled promise rejections or uncaught exceptions.
